# Cycles-in-the-Biosphere

Interactive environmental education resource
Cycles in the Biosphere aims to be an interactive web based education resource covering cyclic systems in the biosphere.
This project will serve as a learning platform for me to develop skills in Adobe Creative Cloud, web design and programming.
The project aims to be a useful resource for all ages and levels with access to increasingly complex learning
controlled within the application.

Initially the project will be a HTML5/CSS3 project but ultimately additional platforms will be addressed, i.e. iPhone, ASP.NET etc.
